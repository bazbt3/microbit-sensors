## What is this?

A program to display values from 4 of the [BBC micro:bit V2's](https://microbit.org) onboard sensors (temperature, compass, light level and microphone.)

## What is a BBC micro:bit?

An [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) computer half the size of a credit card.  Code must be written on a computer or a portable device before 'flashing' the program to the micro:bit via a USB cable or Bluetooth.

## How was the program created?

I used the Microsoft MakeCode IDE (blocks of code similar to Scratch) in [the iPhone micro:bit app.](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/micro-bit/id1092687276).  However, [other apps and languages](https://microbit.org/code/) can be used.

Note: I used only the block editor so be aware that the MicroPython and is not ordered 'neatly'.
